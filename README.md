## Hi there, I'm Apoorva ðŸ‘‹. 
- ðŸ”­ I'm a Data Scientist working @ Intuit, and recently my focus has been expediting GenAI experiences by building custom Langchain Tools and Agentic workflows. 
Before the shift towards GenAI, I spent 2 years working in the field of traditional ML, explored the areas of uncertainity quantification among other data sciency stuff!
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently practicing my juggling skills at catching up with latest research, and upskilling my software development skillset.
- ðŸ“– I'm currently reading: Thinking fast and Slow, The Messy Middle. Always open for some interesting book recs!
- ðŸ“« If you'd like to connect: here's my [Linkedin](www.linkedin.com/in/apoorvabanubakode)
- âš¡ Somethings that I love: a cup of perfect masala chai, poetry that touches the soul, painting, and how can i miss -- puzzles!
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: She/her
